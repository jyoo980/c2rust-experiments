Based on the provided C source file and the CBMC documentation for requires and ensures clauses, here is the header file with the appropriate CBMC specifications:

/**

### Explanation of the Contracts:

1. **mod3329 Function:**
   - **Requires Clause:** The inputs `a` and `b` should be less than 3329. This is a reasonable assumption given the modulus operation with 3329.
   - **Ensures Clause:** The result of the function should be less than 3329, as it is the result of a modulo operation with 3329.

2. **mr1 Function:**
   - **Requires Clause:** The input `a` should be non-negative. This is a reasonable assumption based on the typical use of Montgomery reduction.
   - **Ensures Clause:** The result should be within the range `[-3329, 3329)`. This range is derived from the properties of the Montgomery reduction and the modulus value used in the function.

These contracts help CBMC verify that the functions meet their specified preconditions and postconditions, ensuring correctness and preventing potential errors.
